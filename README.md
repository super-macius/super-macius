<summary><h3>🤗 Biography</h3></summary>
I wanted to be game developer since 2017 - when I played Minecraft for the first time. As a kid I was learning Scratch, and I went to many programming / robotics courses. In 2019 I bought my first laptop and I immediately started learning GameMaker Studio. In 2021 I bought my first PC, at the same time I started learning about computer components. Since then I build around 10 pc's for my friends! To this day I'm helping many people with optimizing, customizing, etc. their pc's. In 2023 I started learning C# and Unity. I'm disciplined in learning these tools and I'm working on my projects at least once a week. In 2024 I started learning Linux (primary Arch), and since 2025 I got into cybersecurity.
